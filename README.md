### Hi There, I'm Sampreet K Chawla ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Engineer currently located at Westfield, IN.  I am a dedicated, result-oriented web developer who believes in bringing ideas online. I have a decade long IT experience beginning from Java Web Developer to Technical Project Manager. I had taken a career break for motherhood, my passion has brought me back here with new energy and perspectives. I recently completed the 500hrs 12-week immersive software engineering course with General Assembly. I am seeking opportunities with agile and engaging companies in challenging, collaborative and flexible environments.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending time with family and keeping myself fit. In my free time I like to volunteer with community schools and libraries.
